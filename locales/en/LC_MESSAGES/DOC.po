msgstr "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is used by organisms living in water bodies as a source of energy necessary for the development of microorganisms. It is produced during the decomposition of dead organisms, and its concentration in water bodies typically ranges from 1 to 20 mg/L. High levels of DOC accumulating at the water's surface affect the extent to which sunlight reaches the organisms living in the water body."
