msgstr "One of the most important parts of water management is monitoring the quality of surface waters. Early detection of deviations from the norm helps prevent natural disasters that could affect any of us."
"One of the monitoring methods is remote sensing, which, using reflected solar radiation at various frequencies, can provide a lot of valuable information. Advances in the field of spectral and temporal resolution of satellite imagery, as well as their general availability, mean that this technology has increasingly broad applications in many different fields."
"The created dashboard allows for the viewing of selected water quality parameters for the counties of Cumbria and Hampshire in the United Kingdom. A description of each parameter is available on a dedicated page, along with a map where the time frames from which the images originate can be adjusted."
"The last tab is dedicated to the analysis of three selected lakes located in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria. For each lake, a single point was selected where Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) measurements are taken, and for each measurement, a satellite image was matched, which was then used to calculate the DOC value. Based on satellite data and field measurements by DEFRA, a calibration coefficient for DOC was developed. Thanks to the calibration of satellite data with real-world data, it is possible to monitor the quality of surface waters with much greater frequency."
