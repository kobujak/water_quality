msgstr "The Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) is used to determine water clarity. The turbidity of a water body is influenced by the amount of organic matter, sediments, and anthropogenic pollutants. NDTI utilizes the property of clear water, which reflects more green light radiation than red. As water transparency decreases in the reservoir, the reflection of red light radiation increases."
