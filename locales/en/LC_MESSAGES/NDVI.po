msgstr "The NDVI index was developed to assess the state and condition of vegetation. It is based on the reflection of the near-infrared and red bands. High index values indicate areas of dense and healthy vegetation. Negative index values indicate water, which allows NDVI to also be used for identifying algae and other contaminants in water bodies."
