msgstr "Turbidity is a water parameter used to determine its clarity. The turbidity of a water body is influenced by the amount of organic matter, sediments, and anthropogenic pollutants. High turbidity in a water body limits the access of organisms to sunlight, which negatively affects the development of the ecosystem. Turbidity is expressed in NTU (nephelometric turbidity units)."
