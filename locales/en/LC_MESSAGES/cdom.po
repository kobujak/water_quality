msgstr "The term colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) refers to the fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that changes the color of water through chromophores. CDOM is naturally formed as a result of the breakdown of organic matter, but it can also originate from outside the water body. To identify and calculate its value, the red and green bands of visible light are used. The highest concentration is observed near the shores of water bodies."
